# 💻 Screen | ```./s```

Welcome to the repository for the Leo's screen utility, a simplified way to interact with the screen utility, meant to be used by beginners in the system administration world. This tool is very simple and provides all the basic features a beginner would need, in order to successfully introduce himself to how the multitasking is handled in linux cli systems.

### ⏳ Installation

It is very simple, here are the steps:
  1. Download the ```s``` file on the machine you're going to use this tool in with this command: ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bestemmie/screen/main/s > s```
  2. Put the file in the folder you prefer
  3. With the file in the same directory as your console, type ```chmod +x s```
  4. [OPTIONAL] You can alias this shell script so it is accessible wherever you are in the filesystem and don't type every single time ./s. In order to alias this script, you'll need to type this out ```alias <command name>=/static/path/to/script/s```. If you want this to be executed every time you login, put this command in the .bashrc or .zshrc file, just at the end of it.

### 😎 You're done

Start using this utility, type ```./s help``` to read the brief guide on how to use it, and for the rest, have fun!
